# Hey there, I'm Destiny!  

**Python Enthusiast | Backend Developer | Future Cybersecurity Wizard**

Welcome to my corner of the internet where I write code, break (into) things ethically, and occasionally Google the same error 17 times in a row.


### 👩‍💻 What I’m Up To:
- Learning **Python** like my life depends on it (which... it kind of does)
- Exploring the **mysterious world of backend development**
- Sneaking into the realm of **ethical hacking & cybersecurity** (legally, of course)
- Building cool little projects to bring it all together

### 🧠 What I Know So Far:
- How to create chaos with `print("Hello, World!")`
- Writing Python scripts that actually *do* things
- The basics of HTML & CSS (just enough to style a page without crying)

### ⚙️ Tools & Tech I'm Loving:

![VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/-VS%20Code-blue?style=flat&logo=visualstudiocode)

### 🌱 Currently Learning:
- APIs & Flask for Python web apps
- SQL for data and backend magic
- Ethical hacking tools and penetration testing
- How not to break everything while learning Linux

### ✨ Fun Facts:
- I studied Biochemistry (so I know my way around a lab *and* a terminal)
- I write SEO content too — yes, I can code *and* charm Google
- I’m learning to fight bugs in both code and cyberspace

### 🧃 On My Desk Right Now:
- A notebook full of to-do lists & error logs
- A cup of tea that’s been reheated 3 times
- A stubborn Python script that refuses to cooperate

### ☀️ Just for Fun:
- I write stories that sometimes turn into blog posts
- I enjoy tweaking UI layouts like it’s an art form
- I secretly want to build my own AI someday
